Task 3: Implement Methods 

Implement methods in your classes to perform various operations related to the Student Information 
System (SIS). These methods will allow you to interact with and manipulate data within your system. 

Below are detailed instructions on how to implement methods in each class: 
Implement the following methods in the appropriate classes: 

Student Class: 
• EnrollInCourse(course: Course): Enrolls the student in a course. 
• UpdateStudentInfo(firstName: string, lastName: string, dateOfBirth: DateTime, email: string, 
phoneNumber: string): Updates the student's information. 
• MakePayment(amount: decimal, paymentDate: DateTime): Records a payment made by the 
student. 
• DisplayStudentInfo(): Displays detailed information about the student. 
• GetEnrolledCourses(): Retrieves a list of courses in which the student is enrolled. 
• GetPaymentHistory(): Retrieves a list of payment records for the student. 

Course Class: 
• AssignTeacher(teacher: Teacher): Assigns a teacher to the course. 
• UpdateCourseInfo(courseCode: string, courseName: string, instructor: string): Updates course 
information. 
• DisplayCourseInfo(): Displays detailed information about the course. 
• GetEnrollments(): Retrieves a list of student enrollments for the course. 
• GetTeacher(): Retrieves the assigned teacher for the course. 

Enrollment Class: 
• GetStudent(): Retrieves the student associated with the enrollment. 
• GetCourse(): Retrieves the course associated with the enrollment. 

Teacher Class:
• UpdateTeacherInfo(name: string, email: string, expertise: string): Updates teacher information. 
• DisplayTeacherInfo(): Displays detailed information about the teacher. 
• GetAssignedCourses(): Retrieves a list of courses assigned to the teacher. 

Payment Class: 
• GetStudent(): Retrieves the student associated with the payment. 
• GetPaymentAmount(): Retrieves the payment amount. 
• GetPaymentDate(): Retrieves the payment date. 

SIS Class (if you have one to manage interactions): 
• EnrollStudentInCourse(student: Student, course: Course): Enrolls a student in a course. 
• AssignTeacherToCourse(teacher: Teacher, course: Course): Assigns a teacher to a course. 
• RecordPayment(student: Student, amount: decimal, paymentDate: DateTime): Records a 
payment made by a student. 
• GenerateEnrollmentReport(course: Course): Generates a report of students enrolled in a 
specific course. 
• GeneratePaymentReport(student: Student): Generates a report of payments made by a specific 
student. 
• CalculateCourseStatistics(course: Course): Calculates statistics for a specific course, such as the 
number of enrollments and total payments. 

Use the Methods 
In your driver program or any part of your code where you want to perform actions related to the 
Student Information System, create instances of your classes, and use the methods you've 
implemented. 
Repeat this process for using other methods you've implemented in your classes and the SIS class.

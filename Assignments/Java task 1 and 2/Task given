Task 1: Define Classes 

Define the following classes based on the domain description: 
Student class with the following attributes: 
• Student ID 
• First Name 
• Last Name 
• Date of Birth 
• Email 
• Phone Number 
Course class with the following attributes: 
• Course ID 
• Course Name 
• Course Code 
• Instructor Name 
Enrollment class to represent the relationship between students and courses. It should have attributes: 
• Enrollment ID 
• Student ID (reference to a Student) 
• Course ID (reference to a Course) 
• Enrollment Date 
Teacher class with the following attributes: 
• Teacher ID 
• First Name 
• Last Name 
• Email 
Payment class with the following attributes: 
• Payment ID 
• Student ID (reference to a Student) 
• Amount 
• Payment Date

Task 2: Implement Constructors 

Implement constructors for each class to initialize their attributes. Constructors are special methods that 
are called when an object of a class is created. They are used to set initial values for the attributes of the 
class. Below are detailed instructions on how to implement constructors for each class in your Student 
Information System (SIS) assignment: 
Student Class Constructor 
In the Student class, you need to create a constructor that initializes the attributes of a student when an 
instance of the Student class is created 
SIS Class Constructor  
If you have a class that represents the Student Information System itself (e.g., SIS class), you may also 
implement a constructor for it. This constructor can be used to set up any initial configuration for the 
SIS. 
Repeat the above process for each class Course, Enrollment, Teacher, Payment by defining constructors 
that initialize their respective attributes.
